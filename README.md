## TODO

See `todo.md` for the current feature checklist and completion status.

## Observations

- The validation of empty placeholders was considered on the server-side (backend), but for this project was deemed unnecessary.

## How to Use

### Backend (Flask)

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend (Angular)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Angular development server:
   ```sh
   ng serve
   ```
